Since receiver clocks are several times less accurate than satellite clocks, even the difference Δ<i>t</i> cannot be determined with accuracy. Thus we don\'t know the exact distance of the receiver form the satellite; we only know an interval of distance in which the receiver is located. Ideally, a satellite signal is propagated in a uniform linear motion.\n\n*More detailed information is provided in the chapter about GNSS problems.";
