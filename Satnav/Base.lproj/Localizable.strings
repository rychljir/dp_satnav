task01_1_text = "When prehistoric man went hunting and found a mammoth, he needed to remember its position in order to come back with the whole band. Hunters used landmarks such as trees, lakes or mountains for positioning. ";

task01_2_text = "Later on, other ways of determining one\'s position in the landscape appeared. The invention of the compass and the creation of maps, used mainly in sea navigation, represented an important step forward. Besides natural landmarks, the landscape filled with man-made landmarks such as castles, churches and other structures. ";

task01_4_text = "As human society developed, people needed to measure distances and determine their position. New instruments made it possible to find out the distance to the nearest neighbouring town, or the area of a farmer\'s field. At sea, it wasn\'t possible to rely on landmarks, so sailors started using the stars for orientation. ";

They could also be used inversely: you could infer your own position from the known position of the stars and the Sun. In the 18th century the astrolabe was replaced by the sextant. Even modern-day sailors learn how to use it in order to be able to determine their position at sea in case the GNSS system fails. ";

The GNSS system and mobile positioning, for example, are based on this principle. The second principle consists in measuring the time it takes for a signal reflected from an object to get back to the transmitter. This is the principle used for radars and laser measurements in surveying. ";

It sends this information to receivers on Earth.";

The information is received by a GNSS receiver, which records the time the signal was received, the time it was sent by the satellite, and the position of the satellite at the moment the signal was sent.\nUnlike satellites, receivers do not measure time with sufficient accuracy (very accurate clocks such as those carried by satellites are too expensive and would dramatically increase the cost of the receiver). As a result, the time of reception is not determined accurately.\n\n<i>t</i> <small><sub>t</sub></small> ...the time a signal is sent from the satellite\n<i>t</i> <small><sub>r</sub></small> ...the time a signal is received by the receiver";

Since receiver clocks are several times less accurate than satellite clocks, even the difference Δ<i>t</i> cannot be determined with accuracy. Thus we don\'t know the exact distance of the receiver form the satellite; we only know an interval of distance in which the receiver is located. Ideally, a satellite signal is propagated in a uniform linear motion.\n\n*More detailed information is provided in the chapter about GNSS problems.";

task02_7_desc = "So now our receiver knows the intervals of distance separating it from each satellite. It also knows the position of the satellites at the time they sent their signals. It can therefore determine the area within which it is located.\nIn mathematical terms, this area is an intersection of parts of spherical cones (with their centres in each of the satellites). To calculate the coordinates, we need to solve three equations with three unknowns.\nTo simplify, we can write down these equations using the Cartesian coordinates <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> (see image).";
