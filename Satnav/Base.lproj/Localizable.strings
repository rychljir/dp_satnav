If GNSS becomes standard equipment of a car, it will be easier to optimize traffic and monitor safety automatically. Autonomous systems are able to quickly evaluate and respond to critical situations. The problem is in the third party liability in case of an accident - whether the liability is imposed on the driver or on the car manufacturer who developed the autonomous system.
